      <h1>Hi, I'm Sahadeva "Saha" Hammari, a designer and entrepreneur living in New York City.</h1>
      <p>I am currently the design director of <a href="https://casetext.com">Casetext</a>, a YC startup using artificial intelligence and design to make the law accessible to everyone in the United States.</p>
      <p>Previously I co-founded and led design at two startups, among other things. CollabFinder was trusted by Google, The City of New York, UC Berkeley, Sir Tim Berners Lee's Open Data Institute and many others to create truly collaborative communities online. Rumplo was the largest T-shirt marketplace on the web and was featured in many prominent publications around the world.</p>
      <p>I have also spoken about design and culture at conferences and festivals around the world. </p>
